# Estimating App

This is my personal project to both help myself learn code, while also creating an application which will be helpful for my current job. 

The idea is to create an application which will hold projects and their various details such as contractor info, trade, date, scope, and materials. 

Like an excel sheet, the user will be able to update scope items and materials, and the application will automatically update pricing. 

## Planned Features

- Basic login / save / load functionality 
- List existing projects
- Create new projects
- Create and edit scope lists
- Create and edit material lists
- Automatic calculation of costs / time based on scope and material lists
- add / create materials with pricing 
- add / create scope tasks with time estimates 

## Reach Goals

These features push outside of my known skills, and would require a lot of external help

- Export project scope and cost into a template Word Document or PDF
- Connectivity with suppliers for automatically updating material pricing
- Ability to purchase material lists directly from App

## Planned Technologies

- PostgresSQL
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
- Tailwind CSS

Node Packages:
- [React-Draggable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-draggable)

*Subject to change*

## Acknowledgements and Inspirations

Currently, the idea for this app came from my own work experience. However, as I progress through the creation of this app, I intend to research other professional apps of a similar nature for guidance and feature inspiration. These will be listed here.
